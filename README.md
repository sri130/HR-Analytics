## Background of HR analytics Model:

A large company namedÂ XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees 
leave the company. Since the attrition level is too high, the management wants to use predictive modelling to bring it down.

Hence, the objectives of the above analysis is to:
Help company XYZ identify current employees that are very likely to leave
Recommend ways for company XYZ to decrease its attrition level in the future.

## Modelling
A total of 24 variables present in the dataset were used to predict the probability of an employee leaving the company in the next year 
using LOGISTIC REGRESSION.

Overall accuracy of the model is 77% i.e., Logistic Regression Model is able to correctly identify 77% of its employees likely to churn.
